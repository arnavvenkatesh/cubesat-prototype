# CubeSat CAD Files

This folder contains the 3D design files for the CubeSat prototype.  
The model was created in **Tinkercad** and exported in standard formats for reuse. I am still new to CAD modelling, thus I have taken up Tinkercad. I plan on moving to Fusion360 soon.

## Contents
- `cubesat_frame.stl` → Main CubeSat frame (1U) in STL format for 3D printing  
- `Pic1 and Pic2` → Quick visual previews (PNG images of the design)  

## Usage
- Import `.stl` files into CAD software (Fusion 360, SolidWorks, FreeCAD, etc.)  
- Use slicer software (e.g. Cura, PrusaSlicer) for 3D printing prototypes  
- View screenshots for a quick look without CAD tools  

## Online Model
The live design can also be viewed on Tinkercad:
